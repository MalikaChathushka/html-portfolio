<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a passionate IT professional with over five years of experience in the technology industry, specializing in software testing, full stack development, and machine learning. My journey began as a web designer and gradually expanded into development and quality assurance, giving me a well-rounded understanding of both building and testing software. Along the way, I have had the opportunity to contribute to diverse projects, from stock exchange platforms to healthcare systems, each of which has strengthened my technical expertise and problem-solving skills.

  What drives me most is the balance between creativity and logic in technology. As a tester, I focus on accuracy, precision, and delivering reliable results. As a developer, I enjoy creating user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems. My ability to switch between these perspectives allows me to bridge the gap between teams and ensure high-quality outcomes. I strongly believe in continuous learning, which is why I keep exploring new tools and frameworks such as React.js, MySQL, Appium, and Cypress.

  Beyond work, I consider myself a motivated and collaborative individual who values teamwork, knowledge sharing, and adaptability. I am always ready to take on challenges, whether working independently or within a team environment. Outside of technology, I enjoy creative projects, engaging in meaningful discussions, and exploring ideas that inspire innovation. My ultimate goal is to grow as a professional while making a positive impact through the projects I contribute to.
